Android port of NGDownloader, originally written in C# by [WEGFan](https://github.com/WEGFan). See [here](https://github.com/WEGFan/NewgroundsSongDownloader).
NGDownloader (Android) is now *updating independently*. Everyone is welcome to fork this project & contribute codes, and I really needs code contributions.

# What is this app used for?

This app is used for downloading songs on [Newgronds](http://newgrounds.com), from which songs used in game GeometryDash by Robtop originated.
It both resolves Newgrounds website and visits Boomlings Database (storing online levels uploaded by GeometryDash players and some level information, e.g. daily levels) as its two strategies to fetch songs.
For detailed information, please view the codes.
